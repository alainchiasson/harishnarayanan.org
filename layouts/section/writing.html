  <p>We love taking Hugo to the park. He is now interested in so many small details, such as the feeling of the grass under his feet, or exploring all the surfaces and shapes on the playground. Of course he wants to touch (and preferably chew) on everything he sees. Today there was also an open air concert at the park that we watched for just a little while. Hugo doesnâ€™t seem too impressed in the video clip, but that was probably just because he was tired. He fell asleep in his pram five minutes later.</p>
