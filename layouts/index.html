<h1 id="main-description">Hi, I’m Harish Narayanan</h1>
<article id="content">
      <p>I’m a quant. Ph.D. that loves learning about and building sophisticated web applications. I share what I learn <a href="/writing/">through my writing</a> and <a href="/projects/">open source projects</a>.</p>
      <p>I’m currently one of the founders and the CTO at <a href="https://edgefolio.com">Edgefolio</a>, a startup building creative solutions for different stakeholders in the hedge fund industry. Previously, I was an applied mathematician and computational scientist studying a range of <a href="/research/">interesting problems in biophysics</a>. You can find out more about my professional history on <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/drharishnarayanan">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
      <p>In addition to changing fields and growing a startup, these past couple of years have seen me getting married to a lovely woman, moving countries, and becoming a father to a <a href="http://narayanan.co/">cute baby boy</a>.</p>
