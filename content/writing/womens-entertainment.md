## The setup

On occasion, I&#8217;m overly drawn into a program on &#8220;<a href="http://www.mylifetime.com/">Lifetime</a>,&#8221; a woman&#8217;s entertainment channel. And by &#8220;overly drawn into,&#8221; I obviously mean that the remote is missing, I&#8217;m too lazy to move, and watch whatever is on; <em>even</em> if it&#8217;s the Lifetime channel.

Yesterday evening was one such occasion. I happened to chance upon a most &#8216;B&#8217; of B-movies, whose name I&#8217;ve already forgotten; or probably never knew in the first place. It was such an experience that I must share its wonderful story with you. Enjoy! (Suckers).

This story is about a young couple who&#8217;re madly in love&#8212;and sexually hyperactive&#8212;a detail that&#8217;ll play an important role in the story&#8217;s progression. Besides, it&#8217;s some unwritten rule somewhere that no-name actors and actresses must show a lot of skin, or they don&#8217;t stand a chance. Anyway, all is well initially as the guy who&#8217;s a PhD in astrophysics (and this has no bearing on the story whatsoever) and the woman who&#8217;s a children&#8217;s book author&#8212;and relatively cute, by B-movie standards&#8212;go about their wonderful life.

But one day&#8212;cue ominous tune&#8212;it all starts going horribly wrong.

It turns out that this young woman has some seriously terminal illness, like lung cancer or something, and about a quarter way through the movie, is very ill, and is soon doing gross things like coughing up fake blood. Since I doubt that few people would want to sleep with someone who&#8217;s throwing up blood (other than the odd lazy vampire, I guess), their sex life begins to suffer.
