If things work out as you've envisioned, there will be a time in your
webapp's lifecycle where it's serving a large number of users. By the
time things get to this point, it's ideal if you've architected your
webapp to both *scale* gracefully to meet this load, and also be
*resilient* to arbitrary failures of underlying compute resources.

This article is about how you can use [Docker
containers][docker-containers] and [Kubernetes][kubernetes] to help
your [Django][django] webapp achieve these architectural goals. While
it meanders a bit through theory and philosophy, it does work up to a
[concrete example][example] to help solidify concepts.

## Caveats

Before we get too deep into the weeds, I'd like to note that the ideas
expressed in this piece don't have anything particular to do with
Django. I've simply chosen it as an example because it is a popular
framework that I'm familiar with. It is straightforward to repurpose
these principles for other software stacks.

I'd also like to point out that this article juggles many moving
pieces -- some quite immature. If you can avoid this level of
complexity at the current stage of your webapp's lifecycle, *you
should*. Instead, focus your efforts on better understanding your
users' problems and testing whether your app solves them. No one is
going to know or complain that you're running your app on a single
fragile server until enough people care to use your app regularly.

*No one.*

With that out of the way, let's get started.

## What are the problems we're trying to solve?

Let's imagine that you're working on a Django webapp that's laid out
in a fairly standard fashion: All your app's data resides in a
PostgreSQL database. The app itself is written in Django-flavoured
Python, and is served up using the uWSGI application server. And in
front of all this, you have the NGINX web server acting both as a
reverse proxy and a static content server.

{{< figure src="/images/writing/kubernetes-django/standard-django-application.svg" title="Layout of a non-trivial Django application." >}}

When you're first starting out with your app and you only have a
handful of users, it makes perfect sense to run all these pieces on a
single server. So you run up to your [favourite cloud
provider][digital-ocean-referral], fire up a VPS running Debian or
whatever, and install all these individual bits of software on the
same machine.

{{< figure src="/images/writing/kubernetes-django/all-in-one-server.svg" title="All pieces making up the app on a single machine." >}}

Then, as your app starts to get more popular, you begin to work on
scaling. At first, you follow the straightforward approach and simply
provision large and larger single machines to run your app in. This is
called *vertical scaling* and works well until you reach a few
thousand users.

And then your app gets *even more* popular.

Now you realise that if you were to split the components making up
your app and put them on separate machines, you can scale the
components independently. Meaning, for example, that you can run
multiple instances of your app (called *horizontal scaling*) to handle
your growing user base, while continuing to run your PostgreSQL server
on only one (but increasingly powerful) machine.

{{< figure src="//placehold.it/1440x960" title="Running many instances of the app, talking to a single database." >}}

This is actually a pretty good strategy until you realise that:

1. It's annoying to have to provision and setup all these server
instances, one for each piece. (All while making sure that the
repeated instances are identical to each other. And making sure the
servers are up-to-date with the latest OS updates, etc.)

2. You need to provision enough Django app instances to cope with your
peak load, but your normal load  doesn't need nearly as many computing
resources. Meaning that under most load scenarios, you're wasting
money.

2. If a computing resource fails --- like someone spills coffee on a
server --- that component of your app simply stops working. ðŸ˜ž

These are the sorts of problems that Docker and Kubernetes are
designed to solve.

## A quick glossary

*What is Kubernetes?*

It's a container orchestration framework that takes "containerised
applications" and schedules them systematically on clusters.

*What's a containerised application?*

It's a piece of software --- like your Django app --- that's been
packaged together along with its underlying requirements and related
data into one convenient bundle, called a *container*.

Some people tend to describe containers as lightweight virtual
machines, but I prefer to think of them as [fat static
binaries][container-perspective] of apps. They form an atomic unit
that can be built, tested and run anywhere as many times as needed.

*What's Docker?*

Docker is an umbrella term covering a lot of disparate things, but for
the purposes of this article, it's a really popular [container
format][docker-containers]. (And it's going to feature prominently in
the example that I assure you we're soon going to get to.)

## So how exactly does Kubernetes help solve these problems?

If we were to "containerise" the pieces of our application and run
them in a replicated way on our closuter, we get the ability to
*scale* our app with load. (If this happens automatically, all the
better.) If we were further able to monitor and heal these containers
(again, thinking of each one as one process of a static binary) ruch
that if they stopped for whatever reason (e.g. if the underlying
hardware died), they'd cleanly be restarted elsewhere, we'd then have
a system that would be *reliable*.

Kubernetes offers a user-friendly API that allows us to do just this.

It contains the following pieces

(A) To achieve our twin goals of scalability and resiliency, we're going
to follow a simple pattern:

1. We break up our Django application into atomic units that can be
easily built, tested and run anywhere.

2. We run multiple copies each kind of unit behind a corresponding
load balancer.

This becomes hard because what about load balancer ip discovery etc.,
making sure your replicas are running etc.? Container techologies like
Docker (or offer) Rocket a plan for the first point, while Kubernetes
offers a plan for the second.

If this seems a bit abstract, let's imagine what a non-trivial webapp
involving Django might look like: (probably goes to (A)):

* A Postgresql database serving as the core persistence tier.
* Memcached providing caching to preventÂ â€¦
* Django + uwsgiÂ â€¦

Now, it's of course possible to run all this and more on a single
Linux server, and it isÂ â€¦ but how would you scale the pieces
independently? E.g., how can you greatly increase the computational
capacity provided by Celery without getting a larger and larger box
(whose resources aren't touched by the other components)? Furthermore,
what happens when this one server goes down for whatever reason?

â€¦ (That business from above that started this section gets moved here)

To simplify this story, we have an app that looks like the following,
or the classic Django app:

database <-> django (uwsgi) <-> nginx <-> users

Adding more pieces to this puzzle is left as an exercise for the
reader. Please submit pull-requests to the original repo. if you work
some of these out.

Break your Django ++ app into pieces (and containerise them). Replace
each individual piece with a load-balancer encompassing a collection
that you can replication manage.

Why and when in an application's lifecycle would you want to do this?

A brief introduction to containerised Django + cohorts

Orchestrating them together with Kubernetes

Explaining some tricks with the sample code to show how the app can be
(manually) scaled to meet known traffic demands. Hit with ab bench (or
whatever it is called), knock a server out and see how it behaves.

### PostgreSQL

#### Persistence

- Create a persistent disk
- Attach to VM
- ssh into VM
- Format disk
- Log out of VM
- Detach from VM

```
gcloud compute disks create --size=500GB --zone=us-central1-a my-data-disk
```

http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes.html#persistent-volumes-and-claims

> A PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of networked storage in the
  cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator. It is a
  resource in the cluster just like a node is a cluster resource. PVs
  are volume plugins like Volumes, but have a lifecycle independent of
  any individual pod that uses the PV. This API object captures the
  details of the implementation of the storage, be that NFS, iSCSI, or
  a cloud-provider-specific storage system.

> A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It
  is similar to a pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV
  resources. Pods can request specific levels of resources (CPU and
  Memory). Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g, can
  be mounted once read/write or many times read-only).
