title: Solving PDEs at scale with TensorFlow
---

TensorFlow is best known as a powerful open source tool for machine
learning. But at its core, it's a general purpose library for numerical
computation, one with an elegant representation of the mathematical
operations. This article explores how you can use TensorFlow for
another interesting class of problem: solving partial differential
equations (PDEs). We first demonstrate this for a particular example
in applied science. We then get to the real story: the construction of
an automated method for solving a wide range of PDEs.
