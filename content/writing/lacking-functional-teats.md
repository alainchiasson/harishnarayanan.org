No matter how much you’re concerned for your friendly neighbours and
would love to give them an evening off; don’t give-in to the urge to
volunteer baby-sitting their baby—especially if the
(now-not-so-)darling little angle is progressing through the final
stages of her teething phase; or you don’t know what you’re doing.

Whatever you do, if in the process of baby-sitting her, she spits up
into your tee, let it go. You can change later. Really, it’s no big
deal.

As you begin to change—after gingerly giving-in to lowering her for a
bit and keeping her in plain sight—whatever you do, put on another
shirt before returning to her; even if she’s begun to _wail_. Really,
it doesn’t take more than five seconds.

Whatever your “instincts” tell you, do not cradle the wailing baby to
your exposed chest while attempting to console her. No,
really. Presenting a decoy, non-functioning teat to a baby with tiny
(but surprisingly effective) teeth is just asking for it.

But it’s not like you’d ever get yourself into such a situation now,
would you?
