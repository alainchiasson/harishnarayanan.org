title: Hi! I'm Harish Narayanan
---

I'm a quant. Ph.D. who loves learning about and building sophisticated
web applications. I share what I learn [through my writing](/blog/)
and [open source projects](/projects/).

I'm currently one of the founders and the CTO at
[Edgefolio](https://edgefolio.com/), a startup building creative
solutions for different stakeholders in the hedge fund
industry. Previously, I was an applied mathematician and computational
scientist studying a range of [interesting problems in
biophysics](/research/).

In addition to changing fields and growing a startup, these past
couple of years have seen me getting married to a lovely woman, and
becoming a father to a [cute baby boy](http://narayanan.co/).

[Being silly on twitter](https://twitter.com/copingbear) is how I cope
with the excitement of it all.
