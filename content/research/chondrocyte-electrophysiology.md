title: An electrophysiological model for the chondrocyte
---

Although osteoarthritis is the most commonly occurring joint disorder,
there exist no drugs that slow down the progression of the
disease. Sufferers of the condition are thus subject to painful and
reduced mobility, resulting in lowered quality of life.

This debilitating joint disorder is generally accepted to be caused
when cartilage between the bones starts to wear out. Cartilage is the
soft tissue that cushions bones at joints and usually allows for the
bones to slide past each other. We are therefore interested in better
understanding wearing out of this tissue layer, but more importantly,
the biological processes involved in its formation, so worn out tissue
can be replaced. For this, we turn our attention to the cell
responsible for the synthesis of cartilage: *the chondrocyte*.

Chondrocytes seem to be at the crux of our story because they are the
single cell type found in cartilage. They are extremely active cells
capable of responding to a range of mechanical and chemical
stimuli. Research indicates that these responses are crucial to their
creation and maintenance of viable cartilage, though the details of
these processes are poorly understood.

In our study, we use computer models of the chondrocyte to better
understand their response to their constantly changing environment. In
particular, we look at how the cellâ€™s [resting membrane
potential](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resting_potential) (RMP)
evolves, as abnormal regulation of the RMP in these cells is linked to
abnormal volume regulation when loaded, altered signaling and cell
death. Focussing our attention on a single chondrocyte cell residing
in deep regions of cartilage, we construct an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) system model that links the membrane potential of the
cell with the flux of various ions in and out of the cell membrane
through ion channels. Our solver for this equation system is
implemented in Octave, and [a current version is
available](http://localhost/files/projects/chondrocyte-model/chondrocyte-model.zip)
as Free Software under the GNU GPL.

When our computer model of the chondrocyte is subjected to several
different clinically-relevant environments, we begin to gain an
understanding of the underlying behavior of the cell. Our research
hints at ideal conditions the cell must be subjected to as it relates
to the synthesis of viable cartilage, and circumstances where this
might be disrupted.

We envision that the insight gained from this work will help in
multiple ways. First, it will help clinicians and biochemists design
better drugs to treat the condition of osteoarthritis. Second, it will
help suggest to patients subtle changes to their lifestyle which could
help reduce the degradation of cartilage resulting from age, greatly
improving their quality of life.
