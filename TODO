The following list is in addition to the liberal `TODO`s sprinkled all
over the code.

- Replace the above non-license with something friendlier
- Replace this file with a useful README. This will serve to replace
  the old "meta" section of the site.
- Go through the TODOs in the code and this list and create a
  collection of isues on GitHub
- Expose RSS feed
- Replace placeholder favicon.ico, apple-touch-icon.png, tile.png
  etc. with something custom
- Grep for and remove all remaining egregious uses of inline styling
- Make large images in article pages overflow the container and go to
  the full width of the page
- Incorporate some taxonomy for the articles (e.g. tags like Devops,
  Kubernetes, Django) to later start connecting up sets of
  articles. Similarly for research articles.
- Incorporate online learning portfolio somewhere?
- Highlight recommended classes
- Add the winter in Asia gallery?
- Canonicalize breakpoints of Pure and Skeleton
- Embed relevant talks in research articles
- Incorporate good ideas from https://github.com/h5bp/server-configs-nginx
